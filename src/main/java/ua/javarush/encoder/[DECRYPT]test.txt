As parts of Europe suffocate from soaring temperatures, some may notice that it can be harder to get a decent night of sleep.

Yet getting an adequate amount of sleep is essential for our well-being with sleep deprivation linked to several chronic health conditions including high blood pressure, obesity and depression.

As summer heatwaves become more frequent amid climate change, here’s a look at how our sleep could be impacted and what you can do to cool down before bed.


How does heat impact our sleep?
Experts recommend sleeping in a room that is between 15 to 20 C for the best night’s sleep, with some research showing that people do not sleep well when the environment is either too warm or too cold.

Kelton Minor, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University in the US, published a study earlier this year that analysed millions of records to determine the impact of temperature on people’s sleep.
